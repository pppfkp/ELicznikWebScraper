# ELicznikScraper
C# web scraping library that extracts data from the Tauron e-licznik website. I developed it to help my dad, who needed an app to perform calculations on energy consumption and production from his PV panels.
The usage is actually pretty straight-forward

After you added a library nuget package you simply create an instance of scraper and then call GetData() method.
